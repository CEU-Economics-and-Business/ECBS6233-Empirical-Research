credits:
    us: 1
    ects: 2
module:  
term: Fall
level: 
    - PhD
prerequisites:
    - At least one PhD-level applied microeconomics course. Can be take concurrently with this course.
description:
    content: The course introduces tools for reproducible research computing and efficient collaboration. We will learn to use plain text and the command line, version control, write modular and readable code. 
    relevance: All empirical work involves significant amounts of computer coding. The time invested in coding is best leveraged if the code can be reused by coauthors, by our future selves and future readers. 
learning_outcomes:
    - Understand folder structure. Perform operations in the command line on files in different folders.
    - Use a modular folder and file structure for empirical projects.
    - Automate repeating tasks with Stata scripts, using for loops and programs.
    - Read and write data in various formats in Stata. Explore data and fix common data quality errors.
    - Filter, aggregate, reshape, and combine data for analysis.
    - Automate and parametrize model estimation.
    - Combine different data cleaning and estimation tasks using Makefiles.
