\title{On balance tests}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

%\subsection{}
Let  $Y_i $ be a continuous, or discrete, variable and  $ T_i $ a dummy variable which takes either values one or zero with probability $p$ and $1-p$, respectively. A regression of $Y_i $ on $T_i$ and a constant is equivalent to comparing means for the two groups, one with values of $T=0$ and the other with values of $T=1$. It can be shown that:


 \begin{align*}
\beta = \frac{cov[Y, T]}{var(T)}=\frac{p(1-p)(E[Y_i|T_i=1]- E[Y_i|T_i=0])}{p(1-p)}=E[Y_i|T_i=1]- E[Y_i|T_i=0]
 \end{align*}

In case of endogenous regressor, mean comparison and linear regression suffer from the same bias. To see this:

 \begin{align*}
 E[Y_i|T_i=1] &=&  \alpha +  \beta  +  E[\varepsilon_i|T_i=1] \\
 E[Y_i|T_i=0] &=&  \alpha  + E[\varepsilon_i|T_i=0]\\
 E[Y_i|T_i=1]- E[Y_i|T_i=0] &= &  \beta +  \underset{\text{selection bias}}{\underbrace{ E[\varepsilon_i|T_i=1] -   E[\varepsilon_i|T_i=0] }}
 \end{align*}

 A numerical example is shown in Table \ref{t: selection} with replication material on \href{https://github.com/CEU-Economics-and-Business/ECBS6233-Empirical-Research/tree/master/code}{GitHub}.\\

A covariate balance test helps us understand if treatment and control group are actually comparable. The variables to include in a balancing test are these variables which are usually measured pre-treatment. See Figure  \ref{fig:tikz} for a visual representation. Geographical variables such as latitude, longitude, altitude, ruggedness, distance, surface are also unlikely to be affected by the treatment and can be included in a balance test. \\

If the variables are measured post-treatment, it's likely they are affected by the treatment, therefore they should not be included in a balancing test as they are outcomes. \\

We encourage you to use visual representations to show covariate balance if possible. A nice example of pre and post mean comparison is shown in Figure \ref{fig:aej} where raw means are plotted before and after treatment. An alternative way would be using coefficient plots.

In many cases, it makes sense to have a mean comparison controlling for other factors. For example, if the assignment is stratified, you would want to look the regression coefficient once you have controlled for other stuff i.e include school fixed, $ \eta_s $, effects because the treatment is stratified at the school level. $\rho$ is the parameter of interest.


\begin{align*}
x_i =  \alpha + \rho T_i + \eta_s + \varepsilon_i
\end{align*}
 
 
 If you are testing if one, or several covariates, are affecting treatment, straightforward tests are bivariate regressions of the form:
 
 \begin{align*}
T_i = \alpha + \beta x_i+ \varepsilon_i
\end{align*}
 
The $\beta$ coefficients inform us if one or some covariates affect treatment individually.\\


In case you want to check whether several variables affect the treatment  jointly, the specification to run is:
 \begin{align*}
 T_i = \alpha + X_i ^\intercal \gamma+ \eta_s + \varepsilon_i
\end{align*}
 
Note that $X_i$ is a vector of covariates. An $F$-test on the joint significance, whether all covariates jointly affect treatment, should be reported.
