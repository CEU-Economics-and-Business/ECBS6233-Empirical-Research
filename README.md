# Empirical-Research
Material Empirical Research


## Course Description: 
This course guides you through the process of empirical research in applied microeconomics, from selecting research ideas and appropriate methods, through collecting data, to submitting your final paper to a journal. We won't talk about these steps, we will do these steps together. Each student and instructor completes a paper during the two terms of the course, which they submit at the end of the course to peer-reviewed journals.

##  Learning Outcomes: 
A complete, finished paper, submitted to a peer reviewed journal.
Applicable, hands-on experience with how empirical research is done:

- select a research idea

- review the literature

- collect data

- select appropriate tools and methods

- iterate through analysis

- ensure reproducibility

- write and present results

## Assessment: 
Course is Pass/Fail.
Active class participation is required. Each student presents their work in progress three times in each term. Participants critique and support one another.
Paper submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. Receipt from journal office.

## Prerequisites: 
Sufficient background in both:
- Applied econometrics, especially causality (experiments, differences in differences, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity)
- At least one field of applied microeconomics (labor economics, corporate governance, international trade, industrial organization, etc)
